<h3 id="components-of-misol-overview">1 Components of MISOL
(Overview)</h3>
<p>MISOl consists of four major components accessible in four different
tabs of the web interface. The first component defines sound classes and
sound laws. The former allow to group sounds into arbitrary units, and
the latter allow to define how sounds in an ancestral language change
into sounds in a descendant language in a certain context. The second
component allows to convert words in the ancestral language into words
in the descendant language (also known as “forward reconstruction”), and
the third component allows to guess from which words in the ancestral
language a given word in the target language has evolved. The fourth
component allows to import and export data in text form, enabling users
to store their analyses, parse the data with additional software tools,
or to compare different approaches to solve the same problem in
phonological reconstruction. The components are summarized in Figure
1.</p>

<h3 id="defining-sound-classes-tab-classes-and-laws">2 Defining Sound
Classes (Tab “Classes and Laws”)</h3>
<p>The table of sound classes defines sounds in a very simple way, by
assigning one or more sounds or sound classes to a certain sound class
label on each line. Sound classes are read in from the first to the last
line and definitions are stored at the time a line is parsed. As a
result, sound class assignments can be combined, and an existing sound
class can be assigned to another class.</p>
<p>The assignment of one or more sounds or sound classes to a given
sound class is represented in the form:</p>
<div class="mycode">
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">name</span> = sound1 sound2 sound3</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <code>name</code> of a sound class must be alphanumeric, similar
to typical Python variables, and should not start with a number. The
<code>=</code>-sign must have a space to the left and to the right. All
sounds (or sound groups referenced by invoking an existing sound class
name) must be separated by a space.</p>
<p>Thus, the following examples for sound class definitions are all
<em>wrong</em>:</p>
<div class="badcode">
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="va">name</span><span class="op">=</span>sound1 <span class="ex">sound2</span> sound3</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">name</span> =sound1 sound2 sound3</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="va">name</span><span class="op">=</span> <span class="ex">sound1</span> sound2 sound3</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">1name</span> = sound1 sound2 sound3</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Internally, a sound class is an ordered list of sounds. By assigning
sounds to a sound class, the sounds are made available to the MISOL
system to act as source and target of sound change processes and to be
referenced in sound laws. In addition to referencing groups of sounds
with the help of sound class variables, all individual (“terminal”)
sounds are also represented in as sound classes. The difference is that
these classes have the same label as the sound iself and that they
contain only one element (the sound they refer to).</p>
<p>Furthermore, each final symbol that is identified as a sound (and not
a sound class name) by the MISOL system is also assigned to its own
class with one single manner. Thus, the following line will define as
many as 5 internal sound classes, of which four have one single member,
and the first targets the four only sounds in the system.</p>
<pre><code>my_class = a b c d</code></pre>
<p>Thus, internally, this will result in the following key-value
representation:</p>
<div class="mycode">
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre
class="sourceCode json"><code class="sourceCode json"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">{</span></span>

<span id="cb4-7"><a href="#cb4-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>When parsing sound laws, MISOL automatically checks for sounds that
have not been referenced in the sound class table and adds them as
individual sounds to the table of sound classes. As a result, you do
<strong>not need to define sound classes in order to define sound
laws</strong>.</p>
<p>In order to check which sound classes have been defined in MISOL,
click on the SHOW CLASSES AND LAWS button, after having inserted your
sound class definitions and your sound laws in the <em>Classes and
Laws</em> tab. A table will open and present you all sound classes that
have been defined, including both those classes that you defined
actively, as well as those classes that were inferred automatically from
the sound laws you defined.</p>
<p>When you check the sound classes in MISOL, you will see that the list
of classes shows three sound classes in the beginning, which are
provided independently of what you have defined or not. These reserved
classes, are the symbols <code>^</code>, <code>$</code>, and
<code>-</code>. <code>^</code> refers to the beginning of a sequence and
can be used in the context string of a sound law. The same holds for
<code>$</code> referring to the end of a sequence. <code>-</code> refers
to a specific sound law in which an element is lost (rather than being
replaced by something). It can also be used as a source sound (in the
case of epenthesis, which must be actively modeled) or as a target sound
in a sound law. Other than for this specific purpose, the symbols should
not be used.</p>
<p>Sound classes are a way to model distinctive features that define
individual sounds. The difference between feature-bundle representations
for sounds in sound change models is that features are flexibly defined
on the fly, and modeled rather as “tags” of individual sounds, or a
shortcut to reference the sounds that are tagged with a certain sound
class name in an ordered manner. In our opinion, this comes quite close
to the way feature bundles are used intuitively by linguists so far,
since one can define one’s sound system in a convenient manner, and
provide major distinctions that may play a role in sound laws, such as
voicing distinctions of consonants:</p>
<div class="mycode">
<pre><code>voiced = b d g
voiceless = p t k</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Another important aspect of sound classes is that they can be used as
a shortcut for a group of sounds in sound laws, which often consist of
an abstract set of independent sound changes, rather than an individual
sound change that occurs in one context alone. As a result, one can
refer to both individual sounds and to sound classes in the sound law
descriptions of MISOL.</p>
<p>As a further note on the way in which sound classes are handled in
MISOL, consider the following assignments:</p>
<div class="mycode">
<pre><code>voiced = b d g
voiceless = p t k
consonant = voiced voiceless m n ŋ</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This translates internally to the following major sound class
representations:</p>
<div class="mycode">
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre
class="sourceCode json"><code class="sourceCode json"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">{</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="dt">&quot;voiced&quot;</span><span class="fu">:</span> <span class="ot">[</span><span class="st">&quot;b&quot;</span><span class="ot">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;d&quot;</span><span class="ot">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;g&quot;</span><span class="ot">]</span><span class="fu">,</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="dt">&quot;voiceless&quot;</span><span class="fu">:</span> <span class="ot">[</span><span class="st">&quot;p&quot;</span><span class="ot">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;t&quot;</span><span class="ot">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;k&quot;</span><span class="ot">]</span><span class="fu">,</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="dt">&quot;consonant&quot;</span><span class="fu">:</span> <span class="ot">[</span><span class="st">&quot;b&quot;</span><span class="ot">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;d&quot;</span><span class="ot">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;g&quot;</span><span class="ot">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;p&quot;</span><span class="ot">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;t&quot;</span><span class="ot">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;k&quot;</span><span class="ot">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;m&quot;</span><span class="ot">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;n&quot;</span><span class="ot">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;ŋ&quot;</span><span class="ot">]</span></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Thus, if a sound class like <code>voiced</code> has been assigned to
a list of sounds, the label can be reused in order to assign the same
group of sounds to another sound class. Internally, all sound classes
are only represented as a group of terminal sounds, and only sound laws
can be reused in assignments if they have already be defined. As a
result, the following order of assignments would be problematic:</p>
<div class="badcode">
<pre><code>consonant = voiced voiceless m n ŋ
voiced = b d g
voiceless = p t k</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Since <code>voiced</code> and <code>voiceless</code> have not been
introduced yet with their target group of sounds, the interpreting code
of MISOL would treat them as individual sounds (which can be represented
by any string combination, provided it does not contain a space).
Invididual sounds, however cannot be assigned to another group of
sounds, since they are internally assigned to a group of one sound only,
so the program throws a warning here and ignores the corresponding
line.</p>
<p>Since MISOL does not care how you define your sounds, it offers the
possibility to work with groups of sounds as well as with individual
sounds when dealing with sound change. In order to make sure that we
distinguish groups from individual sounds, the recommendation is to use
a dot <code>.</code> between sounds in a sound sequence in order to
indicate that one is not dealing with individual phonemes. Thus, the
final or rhyme of a Chinese word like <code>[</code>kwaŋ<code>]</code>
could then be conveniently written as <code>a.ŋ</code>. MISOL, however,
will treat this sequence of grouped sounds as an individual sound class
(potentially a terminal one) and not assign it a specific semantics.</p>
<p>Since sound classes are ordered lists of sounds, nothing speaks
against it if you assign the same sound multiple times to one and the
same sound class. This may be important in cases where <em>mergers</em>
are described in complex sound laws that deal with more than one input
sound.</p>
<p>There are two symbols which are automatically defined as sounds,
which cannot be assigned to sound class groups: <code>^</code>
represents the beginning of each word and <code>$</code> the end.
<code>#</code> is reserved as a comment marker.</p>
<h3 id="defining-sound-laws-tab-classes-and-laws">3 Defining Sound Laws
(Tab “Classes and Laws”)</h3>
<p>A sound law is an abstract formula that shows how one or more sounds
in an ancestral language are converted to one or more sounds in a
descendant language. It has the general formula:</p>
<div class="mycode">
<pre class="shell"><code>source &gt; target / context</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The number of source sounds and target sounds must be identical and
the context is optional and can be omitted:</p>
<div class="mycode">
<pre class="shell"><code>source &gt; target</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The change marker <code>&gt;</code> must be preceded and followed by
a space. So the following lines would be erroneous and lead to
errors.</p>
<div class="badcode">
<pre class="shell"><code>source&gt; target
source &gt;target
source&gt;target</code></pre>
</div>
<h4 id="source-and-target-in-sound-laws">3.1 Source and Target in Sound
Laws</h4>
<p>Source and target can be either a single sound, sound class, or list
of sounds (indicated by square brackets) or a sequence of sounds. If a
sequence of sounds is provided, this will be interpreted internally by
invoking two or more separate sound laws. Thus, writing</p>
<div class="mycode">
<pre><code>a b &gt; [c d / x _ y</code></pre>
</div>
<p>is equivalent to writing</p>
<div class="mycode">
<pre><code>a &gt; c / x _ b y
b &gt; d / x a _ y</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Allowing to define consecutive sounds is thus a mere shortcut but it
can come in handy in those cases where it seems difficult to define
complex sound laws.</p>
<p>If you pass a sound class, a single sound, or a list of sounds does
not make a difference. Thus, if you have defined a sound class
<code>ptk</code> as shortcut for the sounds <code>p</code>,
<code>t</code>, and <code>k</code>, the following two statements are
equivalent:</p>
<div class="mycode">
<pre><code>ptk &gt; ptk
[p t k] &gt; [p t k]</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The same holds for sequences of sounds:</p>
<div class="mycode">
<pre><code>ptk ptk &gt; ptk ptk
[p t k] [p t k] &gt; [p t k] [p t k]</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Mixing is also possible.</p>
<div class="mycode">
<pre><code>ptk [p t k] &gt; [p t k] ptk</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Note, however, that it is essential that the source and the target
always contain the <em>same amount of sounds</em> and the <em>same
amount of positions</em>. If you want to indicate the loss of a sound,
use the <code>-</code> as gap marker:</p>
<div class="mycode">
<pre><code>ptk ptk &gt; ptk [- - -]</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Note in this example, that you cannot write a single gap symbol, but
must assemble a group (or define a sound class with the group before),
since we require to have one target sound for each source sound and vice
versa. This means also, that you must repeat a sound when using sound
class notations to formulate sound laws, where a merger happens.</p>
<div class="mycode">
<pre><code>[p t k] &gt; [p p p]</code></pre>
</div>
<p>MISOL will in all cases represent sound laws individually, on the
basis of one source sound corresponding to one target sound in one
individual context.</p>
<h4 id="context-in-sound-laws">3.2 Context in Sound Laws</h4>
<p>The context typically has the form:</p>
<div class="mycode">
<pre><code>left_context _ right_context</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Here, <code>_</code> represents the source sound. Both left and right
context can be omitted.</p>
<div class="mycode">
<pre><code>left_context _
_ right_context</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Context in left and right context is identically defined by a
segmental representation of the sound sequence proceeds to the left in
the left context and to the right in the right context. In this way,
theoretically even very long ranging contexts can be modeled. If one
wants to change an <code>[</code>s<code>]</code> followed by
<code>[</code>p, t, k<code>]</code> and a vowel to
<code>[</code>ʃ<code>]</code>, one can write:</p>
<div class="mycode">
<pre><code>s &gt; ʃ / _ [p t k] vowel</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Here, the square brackets <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> are used
to indicate that the three sounds <code>p</code>, <code>t</code>, and
<code>k</code> represent a group that can alternatively occur in the
second position following the source sound. A full-fledged toy example
that would model that an <code>s</code> becomes voiced when followed by
a vowel and turns into a <code>ʃ</code> when followed by a consonant and
a vowel, one could define the following sound classes:</p>
<div class="mycode">
<pre><code>consonant = p t k b d g s z ʃ
ptk = p t k b d g
vowel = a e i o u</code></pre>
</div>
<p>These could then be used in four sound laws:</p>
<div class="mycode">
<pre><code>s &gt; ʃ / _ [p t k] vowel
s &gt; z / _ vowel
p t k b d g &gt; p t k b d g
vowel &gt; vowel</code></pre>
</div>
<p>These would turn a word like <code>s t a b</code> into
<code>ʃ t a b</code> but would turn <code>s a b</code> into
<code>z a b</code>.</p>
